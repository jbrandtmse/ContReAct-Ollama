## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before contributing, ensure you have:

- Python 3.9 or higher installed
- Ollama installed and running locally
- Git configured with your name and email
- A GitHub account

### Setting Up Development Environment

1. **Fork the repository** on GitHub

2. **Clone your fork**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ContReAct-Ollama.git
   cd ContReAct-Ollama
   ```

3. **Add upstream remote**:
   ```bash
   git remote add upstream https://github.com/originalowner/ContReAct-Ollama.git
   ```

4. **Create a virtual environment**:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

5. **Install development dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
   ```

6. **Install pre-commit hooks** (if available):
   ```bash
   pre-commit install
   ```

## üìù Development Workflow

### Creating a Branch

Always create a new branch for your work:

```bash
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
# or
git checkout -b fix/bug-description
```

Branch naming conventions:
- `feature/` - New features
- `fix/` - Bug fixes
- `docs/` - Documentation updates
- `refactor/` - Code refactoring
- `test/` - Test additions or modifications

### Making Changes

1. **Follow the coding standards** defined in [docs/architecture.md](docs/architecture.md#coding-standards)

2. **Write clear, descriptive commit messages**:
   ```
   type(scope): Brief description
   
   Detailed explanation of what changed and why.
   
   Fixes #issue-number
   ```
   
   Types: `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `style`, `refactor`, `test`, `chore`

3. **Add tests** for new functionality:
   - Unit tests in `tests/unit/`
   - Integration tests in `tests/integration/`
   - Aim for >80% code coverage

4. **Update documentation** if needed:
   - Update README.md for user-facing changes
   - Update architecture.md for technical changes
   - Add docstrings to all new functions/classes

### Code Quality Standards

#### Type Hints

All functions must have complete type annotations:

```python
from typing import List, Dict, Optional

def process_data(input_data: List[str], config: Dict[str, Any]) -> Optional[str]:
    """Process input data according to configuration."""
    pass
```

#### Docstrings

Use Google-style docstrings:

```python
def execute_cycle(self, agent_state: AgentState) -> AgentState:
    """
    Execute a single cycle of the ContReAct state machine.
    
    Args:
        agent_state: Current state of the agent including message history
        
    Returns:
        Updated agent state after cycle completion
        
    Raises:
        CycleExecutionError: If cycle execution fails
        
    Example:
        >>> orchestrator = CycleOrchestrator(config)
        >>> new_state = orchestrator.execute_cycle(initial_state)
    """
    pass
```

#### Code Formatting

Run these before committing:

```bash
# Format code
black --line-length 100 contreact_ollama/
isort contreact_ollama/

# Check formatting
black --check --line-length 100 contreact_ollama/

# Type checking
mypy contreact_ollama/

# Linting
flake8 contreact_ollama/
```

### Testing

#### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
pytest

# Run with coverage
pytest --cov=contreact_ollama --cov-report=html

# Run specific test file
pytest tests/unit/test_cycle_orchestrator.py

# Run tests matching pattern
pytest -k "test_similarity"
```

#### Writing Tests

Follow the test naming convention:

```python
def test_<method>_<scenario>_<expected_result>():
    """Test that <method> <expected_result> when <scenario>."""
    # Arrange
    config = create_test_config()
    orchestrator = CycleOrchestrator(config)
    
    # Act
    result = orchestrator.some_method()
    
    # Assert
    assert result == expected_value
```

Use fixtures for common setup:

```python
import pytest

@pytest.fixture
def sample_agent_state():
    """Provide sample AgentState for testing."""
    return AgentState(
        run_id="test-run",
        cycle_number=1,
        model_name="llama3:latest",
        message_history=[],
        reflection_history=[]
    )
```

### Submitting Changes

1. **Ensure all tests pass**:
   ```bash
   pytest
   ```

2. **Ensure code is formatted**:
   ```bash
   black --check contreact_ollama/
   mypy contreact_ollama/
   ```

3. **Commit your changes**:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "feat(component): Add new feature"
   ```

4. **Update your branch with upstream changes**:
   ```bash
   git fetch upstream
   git rebase upstream/main
   ```

5. **Push to your fork**:
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```

6. **Create a Pull Request** on GitHub
