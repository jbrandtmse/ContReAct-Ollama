  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: "No security concerns. Input validation appropriate, no sensitive data handling, safe rendering."
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Excellent performance for UI purposes. Streamlit handles state efficiently, no heavy computations."
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Form validation is robust. Widget constraints prevent invalid input. Error handling is clear."
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Code refactored to use named constants. Clear structure, well-documented with help text."
