  strengths:
    - "Clean separation of concerns (config dataclass, runner class, CLI script)"
    - "Comprehensive type hints and Google-style docstrings"
    - "Security best practice: yaml.safe_load() instead of yaml.load()"
    - "Specific exception handling with actionable error messages"
    - "Proper test coverage at appropriate levels (unit and integration)"
    - "All acceptance criteria fully satisfied"
  
  refactoring_applied:
    - file: "scripts/run_experiment.py"
      change: "Enhanced error handling specificity"
      reason: "Added explicit exception handlers for yaml.YAMLError, KeyError, TypeError, and ValueError for clearer user feedback"
