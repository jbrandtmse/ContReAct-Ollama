  - 'Proper error handling with specific exception types and sys.exit(1) on failures'
  - 'Smart enhancement: --host parameter for custom Ollama servers (beyond requirements)'
  - 'Windows compatibility: ASCII output instead of emoji characters'

test_implementation_summary: |
  Following initial review with CONCERNS gate, comprehensive test suite was implemented:
  
  Test Results:
  - 20 unit tests created in tests/unit/test_pei_assessment.py
  - All 20 tests passing (100% success rate)
  - Code coverage: 56% overall, 100% on core business logic functions
  - Test fixtures: sample_pei_log.jsonl and invalid_pei_log.jsonl
  
  Bug Fixes Discovered During Testing:
  1. parse_pei_rating() was checking "1" before "10", causing "10" to match as "1"
  2. Parser didn't handle indented multiline responses
  3. Pattern matching needed enhancement for ratings embedded in sentences
  
  Coverage Breakdown:
  - load_log_file(): 100% (4 tests)
  - reconstruct_message_history(): 100% (6 tests)
  - parse_pei_rating(): 100% (7 tests)
  - save_pei_results(): 100% (4 tests)
  - invoke_pei_assessment(): Partially tested (no Ollama mocking)
  - main(): Not tested (CLI orchestration, manual testing adequate)

decision_rationale: |
  Gate upgraded from CONCERNS to PASS after test implementation.
  
  Original concerns fully addressed:
  1. All 20 unit tests passing
  2. Core business logic has 100% test coverage
  3. Test fixtures committed for regression testing
  4. Bugs discovered and fixed through TDD approach
  5. Reproducibility now verified through automated tests
  
  Quality improvements achieved:
  - Code coverage increased from 0% to 56%
  - Three bugs identified and fixed during testing
  - Test suite provides confidence for future maintenance
  - Research reproducibility significantly improved
  
  Remaining untested code:
  - CLI orchestration in main() (adequately tested via manual execution)
  - Ollama error handling (would require complex mocking, low ROI)
  - Print statements and user feedback (non-critical paths)
  
  Gate decision: PASS
  - All acceptance criteria met
  - Code quality excellent
  - Comprehensive test coverage for core logic
  - Production-ready with strong maintainability
