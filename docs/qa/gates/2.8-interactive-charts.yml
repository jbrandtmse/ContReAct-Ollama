nfr_validation:
  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'Input validation on DataFrame columns before use. Proper exception handling prevents information leakage. No user-controlled file paths or SQL queries. Safe data aggregation using pandas built-in methods.'
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'Efficient pandas groupby for aggregation. Client-side chart rendering (Plotly in browser). No unnecessary data copies or iterations. Appropriate data structure choices.'
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'Comprehensive error handling with graceful degradation. Handles missing data, invalid payloads, and rendering errors without crashes. Clear user-facing messages for all error scenarios.'
  maintainability:
    status: CONCERNS
    notes: 'Missing type hints and docstrings reduce code maintainability. Chart generation logic should be extracted to utility functions. Function length exceeds 50-line guideline.'
