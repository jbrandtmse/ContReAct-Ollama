nfr_validation:
  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Filename sanitization prevents path traversal. Safe YAML dumping. No sensitive data handling."
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: "File I/O operations minimal and appropriate. YAML serialization efficient for config files."
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Comprehensive error handling for PermissionError, OSError (disk full), and generic exceptions. Clear error messages."
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Well-structured functions with single responsibilities. Type hints and Google-style docstrings. Minor improvement: extract 'configs' as constant."

  risks:
    - severity: low
      description: "Directory name 'configs' is a magic string"
      impact: "Minor maintainability concern"
      mitigation: "Consider extracting as module-level constant in future refactoring"
    - severity: low
      description: "Test file duplicates functions instead of importing"
      impact: "Maintenance burden if functions change"
      mitigation: "Pragmatic decision to avoid Streamlit mocking complexity - acceptable trade-off"
