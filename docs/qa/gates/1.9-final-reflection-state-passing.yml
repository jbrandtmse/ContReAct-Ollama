nfr_validation:
  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: "No security concerns. Internal state management with no external inputs."
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Efficient list copy operations. Linear growth of reflection_history is expected and acceptable."
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "State isolation correctly implemented. Empty reflection edge case handled properly."
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Clean code with proper documentation. Minor comment update applied during review."

test_architecture_assessment:
  coverage_adequacy: "Excellent - 5 comprehensive tests covering all acceptance criteria and edge cases"
  test_level_appropriateness: "Correct - all unit tests at appropriate level"
  test_design_quality: "High quality with clear mocking strategy and comprehensive scenarios"
  edge_case_coverage: "Complete - empty reflections, multi-cycle persistence, message_history reset"
  mock_strategy: "Appropriate use of mocks for _execute_cycle method"

post_implementation_fixes:
  - date: "2025-10-10"
    issue: "Outdated comment in _load_state() method"
    fix: "Updated comment to reflect current implementation where reflection_history is managed by run_experiment()"
    verification: "Code review during QA assessment"
    impact: "Low - documentation clarity improvement"
  - date: "2025-10-10"
    issue: "CRITICAL: reflection_history persisted but not provided to LLM in prompts"
    fix: "Modified build_prompt() in prompt_assembler.py to inject reflection_history into system prompt. Added '## Your Previous Reflections' section with numbered cycle reflections when reflection_history is non-empty."
    verification: "Added 3 comprehensive tests covering reflection inclusion scenarios. All 102 unit tests pass."
    impact: "Critical - Agent can now actually read its previous reflections, fulfilling the stated design in SYSTEM_PROMPT"
