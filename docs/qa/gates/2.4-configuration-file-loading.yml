nfr_validation:
  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: "yaml.safe_load() prevents code injection. File paths properly handled with Path objects. No sensitive data exposure in error messages."
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: "File I/O operations minimal and appropriate. Session state prevents unnecessary reloading. Efficient glob patterns for directory scanning."
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Comprehensive error handling for YAML parsing errors, FileNotFoundError, and generic exceptions. Clear user-facing error messages."
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Type hints and Google-style docstrings present. Single responsibility functions. Good test isolation. CONFIGS_DIR constant extracted during QA review."

    - action: "Consider refactoring testable functions into separate utility module to avoid test duplication (lower priority)"
      refs: ["tests/unit/test_config_file_loading.py", "pages/1_ðŸ§ª_experiment_configuration.py"]
      note: "Current duplication is acceptable given Streamlit import complexity"

refactoring_applied:
  - file: "pages/1_ðŸ§ª_experiment_configuration.py"
    change: "Extracted CONFIGS_DIR module-level constant"
    reason: "Eliminates magic string 'configs' repeated 6 times across functions and UI"
    impact: "Improved maintainability - directory path changes now require single-location update"

acceptance_criteria_validation:
  ac1_dropdown_lists_yaml_files:
    status: PASS
    evidence: "get_config_files() scans configs/ directory, filters .yaml files, sorts alphabetically. st.selectbox() displays with 'Create New Configuration' option."
  ac2_selecting_file_populates_form:
    status: PASS
    evidence: "load_config_file() loads YAML into session state. All form widgets use loaded values or defaults. Handles missing fields gracefully."
  ac3_overwrite_on_save:
    status: PASS
    evidence: "Detects st.session_state.current_file to determine edit mode. Success message indicates overwrite. Integration test confirms workflow."

test_architecture_assessment:
  coverage_quality: "Excellent - 29 unit tests (28 passed, 1 skipped) covering all scenarios including Story 2.3 and 2.4 functionality"
  test_levels:
    unit: "Helper functions tested in isolation with tmp_path fixtures"
    integration: "Workflow tests for loadâ†’editâ†’save and create new after loading scenarios"
    e2e: "Manual testing checklist appropriate for Streamlit UI interactions (not automatable)"
  edge_cases_covered:
    - "Empty configs directory"
    - "Non-existent directory"
    - "Single and multiple config files"
    - "Non-YAML files filtered correctly"
    - "Subdirectories ignored"
    - "Invalid YAML parsing"
    - "Non-existent file loading"
    - "Empty YAML files"
    - "Complete configuration structure with nested objects"
    - "Session state transitions"
  test_maintainability: "Excellent - proper pytest fixtures, justified test duplication (Streamlit mocking complexity), clear naming"
