# Non-Functional Requirements Validation
nfr_validation:
  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Bot token stored as environment variable, authorized users list restricts access, security best practices documented in README"
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Configuration loading is fast, validation consists of basic boolean checks, no I/O beyond reading single environment variable"
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Comprehensive validation with clear error messages, backward compatibility maintained through sensible defaults"
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Excellent code organization with type hints, docstrings, and clear separation of concerns"

# Risk Assessment
risk_summary:
  totals:
    critical: 0
    high: 0
    medium: 0
    low: 1
  recommendations:
    must_fix: []
    monitor:
      - "Consider removing unused telegram_bot_token field from dataclass (currently always None, token read from env var during validation)"

# Recommendations
recommendations:
  immediate: []
  future:
    - action: "Consider removing unused telegram_bot_token field from ExperimentConfig dataclass"
      refs: ["contreact_ollama/core/config.py:32"]
      priority: low
      rationale: "Field is always None; actual token is read from environment variable during validation. Removing would simplify the data model."
    - action: "Add integration test for experiment startup with Telegram validation"
      refs: ["tests/integration/"]
      priority: low
      rationale: "Would enhance confidence in end-to-end configuration loading workflow, though not critical for story completion."
