      - "Monitor reflection_embeddings memory growth for very long experiments (100+ cycles)"

nfr_validation:
  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: "No security concerns. Module operates on internal agent reflections only, uses established ML library (sentence-transformers), no external inputs, no data persistence beyond memory."
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Efficient design with model loaded once, embeddings cached, sklearn cosine_similarity optimization. Initial model download takes ~76 seconds (acceptable for first-time setup). Memory growth is linear and acceptable (<20MB for 10K cycles)."
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Proper edge case handling (empty history, empty reflections). Optional parameters allow feature to be disabled. Clean integration with existing components."
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Excellent code quality with comprehensive docstrings, proper type hints, clean separation of concerns. Follows all project coding standards precisely."

test_architecture_assessment:
  coverage_adequacy: "Excellent - Unit tests (11/11 passing) + Integration tests (4/4 passing) = 15/15 total tests (100%). Complete end-to-end validation."
  test_level_appropriateness: "Optimal - Unit tests at appropriate level for services. Integration tests validate multi-cycle workflow correctly."
  test_design_quality: "High quality with creative approaches (Gram-Schmidt orthogonalization for precise similarity control). Both mocked and real embedding service tests. Integration tests comprehensively validate feedback loop."
  edge_case_coverage: "Complete - empty history, empty strings, multiple historical embeddings, all threshold levels, diverse reflections, identical reflections, moderate similarity scenarios."
  mock_strategy: "Excellent - Appropriate use of mocks for EmbeddingService in SimilarityMonitor tests. Real integration tests validate actual sentence-transformers behavior across cycles."
