# User Interface Design Goals

### Overall UX Vision
The user experience should be simple, clear, and data-focused. [cite_start]The primary goal of the UI is to streamline the experimental workflow, providing an intuitive alternative to manually editing YAML configuration files and parsing raw JSON log data[cite: 662]. It should be accessible to both technical researchers and less-technical enthusiasts.

### Key Interaction Paradigms
The interface will follow a standard web-dashboard paradigm, leveraging the native components of the Streamlit framework. [cite_start]A configuration form with standard widgets (text inputs, number inputs, dropdowns) will be used to generate experiment files[cite: 681]. [cite_start]The results dashboard will display data using interactive charts and tables to facilitate analysis[cite: 693].

### Core Screens and Views
[cite_start]Based on the design specification, the application will be structured into two main pages[cite: 672]:
* [cite_start]**Experiment Configuration Page**: A form-based interface for creating and editing `config.yaml` files[cite: 676].
* [cite_start]**Results Dashboard Page**: A data visualization interface for analyzing completed `.jsonl` run logs[cite: 677].

### Accessibility: None
No formal accessibility standard (like WCAG) is specified in the project requirements. The default accessibility provided by the Streamlit framework will be considered sufficient for the MVP.

### Branding
No specific branding is required. The UI will use a clean, standard theme (light/dark) provided by Streamlit, with a focus on readability and data clarity.

### Target Device and Platforms: Web Responsive
The application is a web-based dashboard intended primarily for use on desktop browsers, as this is the typical environment for this type of data analysis and configuration work. The Streamlit framework provides basic responsiveness for usability on smaller screens.
