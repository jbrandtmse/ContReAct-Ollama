# Next Steps

### UX Expert Prompt
The Product Requirements Document (PRD) for the ContReAct-Ollama Experimental Platform is complete and validated. Please use it as the primary input to create the comprehensive UI/UX Specification (`front-end-spec.md`). Pay special attention to defining the detailed user flows, edge cases, and UI error handling, as these were identified as requiring your specific expertise.

### Architect Prompt
With the PRD and UI/UX Specification complete, please proceed with creating the fullstack architecture document (`fullstack-architecture.md`). Ensure your design incorporates all technical assumptions and constraints from the PRD and aligns with the UI/UX vision.
