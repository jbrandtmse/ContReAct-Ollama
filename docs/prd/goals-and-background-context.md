# Goals and Background Context

### Goals
* To build a software application that faithfully implements the paper's Continuous ReAct (ContReAct) architecture.
* To adapt the platform for use with locally-hosted LLMs served via the Ollama platform.
* To include a web front-end that streamlines the experimental workflow and enhances usability.

### Background Context
This project will create the ContReAct-Ollama Experimental Platform to replicate and explore the findings from the paper "What Do LLM Agents Do When Left Alone?". It addresses a notable gap in the AI research community by providing an accessible tool to study the unprompted behavior of LLM agents, a topic that is largely unexplored in existing task-oriented frameworks.

The platform is specifically designed for personal use by researchers, hobbyists, and enthusiasts within the local Ollama ecosystem. It aims to provide a hands-on learning experience by lowering the barrier to entry for replicating the paper's complex experimental setup.
