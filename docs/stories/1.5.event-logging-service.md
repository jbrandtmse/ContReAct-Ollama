# Story 1.5: Implement Event Logging Service

**Status**: Done

---

## Story

**As a** Researcher,
**I want** all major experimental events to be logged to a structured file,
**so that** I have a complete, auditable record for post-hoc analysis.

---

## Acceptance Criteria

1. A `JsonlLogger` is implemented that writes to a file named `logs/<run_id>.jsonl`
2. The `CycleOrchestrator` uses the logger to record `CYCLE_START` and `CYCLE_END` events for each cycle
3. Each line in the output `.jsonl` file is a valid JSON object conforming to the LogRecord schema

---

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
From Story 1.4:
- CycleOrchestrator created with run_experiment() and _execute_cycle() methods
- AgentState dataclass available with cycle_number field
- ExperimentRunner.initialize_services() initializes services and returns dict

### Data Models to Implement
**Source**: [docs/architecture/data-models.md#logrecord]

Complete LogRecord dataclass and EventType enum:

```python
from dataclasses import dataclass
from datetime import datetime
from typing import Dict, Any, Literal
from enum import Enum

class EventType(Enum):
    """Types of events that can be logged."""
    CYCLE_START = "CYCLE_START"
    LLM_INVOCATION = "LLM_INVOCATION"
    TOOL_CALL = "TOOL_CALL"
    CYCLE_END = "CYCLE_END"

@dataclass
class LogRecord:
    """A single, structured log entry for an experimental event."""
    
    timestamp: str  # ISO 8601 formatted timestamp
    run_id: str  # Identifier for the experiment run
    cycle_number: int  # The cycle in which the event occurred
    event_type: EventType  # The type of event being logged
    payload: Dict[str, Any]  # Event-specific data
```

**Payload Examples by Event Type**:

- **CYCLE_START**: 
  ```python
  {}  # Empty payload for this story, may add metrics later
  ```

- **CYCLE_END**: 
  ```python
  {}  # Empty payload for this story, will add reflection in Story 1.9
  ```

- **LLM_INVOCATION** (for later stories): 
  ```python
  {
      "prompt_messages": [...],
      "response_message": {...},
      "model_options": {...}
  }
  ```

- **TOOL_CALL** (for later stories): 
  ```python
  {
      "tool_name": str,
      "parameters": {...},
      "output": str
  }
  ```

        """
        
    def log_event(self, run_id: str, cycle_number: int, 
                  event_type: EventType, payload: Dict) -> None:
        """

    def __exit__(self, exc_type, exc_val, exc_tb):
        """Context manager exit."""

```

**Log File Path Generation**:

In `ExperimentRunner.initialize_services()`:
```python
# Create logger
log_file_path = f"logs/{self.config.run_id}.jsonl"
logger = JsonlLogger(log_file_path)
services['logger'] = logger
```

### CycleOrchestrator Integration

Update `CycleOrchestrator.__init__()`:
```python
from contreact_ollama.logging.jsonl_logger import JsonlLogger, EventType

class CycleOrchestrator:
    def __init__(self, config: ExperimentConfig, ollama_interface: OllamaInterface,
                 logger: JsonlLogger = None):
        """
        Initialize orchestrator with all necessary services.
        
        Args:
            config: Experiment configuration
            ollama_interface: Ollama interface for LLM communication
            logger: Event logger (optional for now, required in production)
        """
        self.config = config
        self.ollama_interface = ollama_interface
        self.logger = logger
```

Update `run_experiment()` to log events:
```python
def run_experiment(self) -> None:
    """
    Main public method executing full experimental run from Cycle 1 to cycle_count.
    
    Iterates through cycles, executing each one and tracking completion.
    Logs CYCLE_START and CYCLE_END events for each cycle.
    """
    print(f"\nStarting experiment: {self.config.run_id}")
    print(f"Model: {self.config.model_name}")
    print(f"Total cycles: {self.config.cycle_count}\n")
    
    for cycle_num in range(1, self.config.cycle_count + 1):
        # Log cycle start
        if self.logger:
            self.logger.log_event(
                run_id=self.config.run_id,
                cycle_number=cycle_num,
                event_type=EventType.CYCLE_START,
                payload={}
            )
        
        print(f"Cycle {cycle_num} starting...")
        
        # Load state for this cycle
        agent_state = self._load_state(cycle_num)
        
        # Execute cycle

        print(f"Cycle {cycle_num} finished.")
        
        # Log cycle end
        if self.logger:
            self.logger.log_event(
                run_id=self.config.run_id,
                cycle_number=cycle_num,
                event_type=EventType.CYCLE_END,
                payload={}
            )
    
    print(f"\n✓ Experiment {self.config.run_id} completed successfully")
    print(f"✓ Executed {self.config.cycle_count} cycles")
    print(f"✓ Log file: logs/{self.config.run_id}.jsonl")
```

### ExperimentRunner Updates

Update `initialize_services()`:
```python
def initialize_services(self) -> dict:
    """
    Initialize all required services (Ollama, Logger, Tools, etc.).
    
    Returns:
        Dictionary containing initialized service instances
        
    Raises:
        ConnectionError: If Ollama connection fails
        ModelNotFoundError: If model not available
    """
    services = {}
    
    # Initialize Ollama interface
    host = self.config.ollama_client_config.get('host', 'http://localhost:11434')
    ollama_interface = OllamaInterface(host=host)
    
    # Verify model availability
    ollama_interface.verify_model_availability(self.config.model_name)
    
    services['ollama'] = ollama_interface
    
    # Initialize logger
    log_file_path = f"logs/{self.config.run_id}.jsonl"
    logger = JsonlLogger(log_file_path)
    services['logger'] = logger
    
    # NOTE: Other services (Tools, SimilarityMonitor) will be added in later stories
    
    return services
```

Update `run()` to pass logger to orchestrator:
```python
def run(self) -> None:
    """
    Execute the complete experimental run.
    
    Orchestrates the full experiment lifecycle:
    1. Load configuration
    2. Initialize services

    # Load config (should already be done)
    if not hasattr(self, 'config'):
        self.config = self.load_config()
    
    # Initialize services (should already be done)
    if not hasattr(self, 'services'):
        self.services = self.initialize_services()
    
    # Create orchestrator with services
    orchestrator = CycleOrchestrator(
        config=self.config,
        ollama_interface=self.services['ollama'],
        logger=self.services['logger']
    )
    
    # Run the experiment
    orchestrator.run_experiment()
    
    # Close logger
    self.services['logger'].close()
```

### Import Organization
**Source**: [docs/architecture/coding-standards.md#3-code-formatting]

For `contreact_ollama/logging/jsonl_logger.py`:
```python
# Standard library imports
import json
from dataclasses import dataclass, asdict
from datetime import datetime
from enum import Enum
from pathlib import Path
from typing import Dict, Any

# Third-party imports
# (none for this file)

# Local application imports
# (none for this file)
```

For updated `contreact_ollama/core/cycle_orchestrator.py`:
```python
# Standard library imports
from typing import List, Dict, Any, Tuple, Optional

# Third-party imports
# (none for this story)

# Local application imports
from contreact_ollama.core.config import ExperimentConfig
from contreact_ollama.state.agent_state import AgentState
from contreact_ollama.llm.ollama_interface import OllamaInterface
from contreact_ollama.logging.jsonl_logger import JsonlLogger, EventType
```

### Coding Standards
**Source**: [docs/architecture/coding-standards.md]

**Type Hints Required**:
- All method parameters and return types
- Use `Dict[str, Any]` for payload (dynamic structure)
- Use `None` for log_event return type (no return value)

**Docstrings Required**:
- Class-level docstring for JsonlLogger
- Method docstrings with Args sections
- Explain ISO 8601 timestamp format

**File Handling**:
- Use Path objects for file operations
- Ensure parent directories exist before opening file
- Use append mode ('a') to preserve existing logs
- Flush after each write for immediate persistence
- Implement context manager (__enter__/__exit__) for proper cleanup

### Example Log Output

After running a 2-cycle experiment, `logs/llama3-experiment-001.jsonl` should contain:

```json
{"timestamp": "2024-01-08T23:15:00.123456Z", "run_id": "llama3-experiment-001", "cycle_number": 1, "event_type": "CYCLE_START", "payload": {}}
{"timestamp": "2024-01-08T23:15:01.234567Z", "run_id": "llama3-experiment-001", "cycle_number": 1, "event_type": "CYCLE_END", "payload": {}}
{"timestamp": "2024-01-08T23:15:01.345678Z", "run_id": "llama3-experiment-001", "cycle_number": 2, "event_type": "CYCLE_START", "payload": {}}
{"timestamp": "2024-01-08T23:15:02.456789Z", "run_id": "llama3-experiment-001", "cycle_number": 2, "event_type": "CYCLE_END", "payload": {}}
```

Each line is a valid, parseable JSON object with consistent structure.

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-01-09

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

### Code Quality Assessment

The implementation of Story 1.5 demonstrates excellent software engineering practices with a well-architected logging service. The JsonlLogger is cleanly implemented with proper separation of concerns, comprehensive type hints, and thorough documentation. The dataclass pattern for LogRecord provides clear structure, and the EventType enum ensures type safety. File handling is robust with context manager support, proper directory creation, and immediate flush behavior for data persistence.

**Key Strengths:**
- Fixed datetime deprecation issue (using datetime.now(timezone.utc) instead of utcnow())
- Excellent type hints throughout all components
- Comprehensive docstrings following Google-style format
- Proper import organization (standard/third-party/local)
- Context manager implementation for resource cleanup
- Path objects used consistently for file operations
- ISO 8601 timestamp format with timezone awareness
- Clean integration with CycleOrchestrator and ExperimentRunner

**Test Quality:**
- 11 unit tests, all passing (0.15s execution time)
- Excellent test coverage (>90% estimated)
- 4 integration tests with proper Ollama availability handling
- Tests validate all acceptance criteria thoroughly
- Good edge case coverage (empty payload, complex nested payload, chronological order)

### Refactoring Performed

No refactoring was necessary. The code is clean, well-structured, and follows best practices.

### Compliance Check

- Coding Standards: ✓ MOSTLY COMPLIANT [See note below]
- Project Structure: ✓ PASS - Files correctly placed in unified structure
- Testing Strategy: ✓ PASS - Exceeds >80% coverage target
- All ACs Met: ✓ PASS - All 3 acceptance criteria fully validated

**Standards Note:** CycleOrchestrator uses print() statements for user output, which technically violates coding standard #9 ("Use logging module, not print()"). However, this is acceptable for CLI user-facing output and doesn't impact the JsonlLogger implementation which is the focus of this story.

### Improvements Checklist

- [x] All acceptance criteria implemented and tested
- [x] Comprehensive unit test suite (11 tests covering all scenarios)

### Requirements Traceability (Given-When-Then)

**AC1: JsonlLogger writes to logs/<run_id>.jsonl**
- **Given** an experiment with run_id "test-run"
- **When** JsonlLogger is initialized
- **Then** log file is created at logs/test-run.jsonl with parent directories
- **Test Coverage:** test_init_creates_log_file, test_init_creates_parent_directories, test_log_file_path_uses_run_id

**AC2: CycleOrchestrator logs CYCLE_START and CYCLE_END events**
- **Given** an experiment configured for 2 cycles
- **When** CycleOrchestrator.run_experiment() executes
- **Then** 4 events are logged (CYCLE_START + CYCLE_END for each cycle with correct cycle_numbers)
- **Test Coverage:** test_experiment_logs_cycle_events, CycleOrchestrator integration code review

**AC3: Each log line is valid JSON conforming to LogRecord schema**
- **Given** any logged event
- **When** the log file is read
- **Then** each line parses as valid JSON with all required fields (timestamp, run_id, cycle_number, event_type, payload)
- **Test Coverage:** test_log_event_writes_valid_json_line, test_log_event_includes_all_fields, test_log_entries_have_valid_json_structure

### Security Review

✓ PASS - No security concerns identified
- Safe file operations using Path objects
- No injection vulnerabilities (JSON serialization is safe)
- Proper path validation with parents=True, exist_ok=True
- No sensitive data logging in current implementation

### Performance Considerations

✓ PASS - Performance is appropriate for logging service
- flush() ensures immediate write (acceptable overhead for reliability)
- Append mode is efficient for incremental logging
- No blocking operations that would impact experiment execution
- File handle remains open for performance (closed properly via context manager or explicit close())

### Files Modified During Review

None - No modifications were necessary during review.

### Gate Status

Gate: CONCERNS → docs/qa/gates/1.5-event-logging-service.yml

### Recommended Status

✓ Ready for Done - All acceptance criteria met, excellent implementation quality, comprehensive test coverage. The single concern (print vs logging) is minor and doesn't affect functionality or the primary deliverable (JsonlLogger service). Story owner may choose to address this in a future refactoring or accept as-is for CLI output.
