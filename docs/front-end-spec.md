# ContReAct-Ollama Experimental Platform UI/UX Specification

## Introduction

This document defines the user experience goals, information architecture, user flows, and visual design specifications for the ContReAct-Ollama Experimental Platform's user interface. It serves as the foundation for visual design and frontend development, ensuring a cohesive and user-centered experience.

## Overall UX Goals & Principles

### Target User Personas

I will be designing for the two personas defined in the PRD:

- **The AI Researcher / Hobbyist**: For this technical user, "simple" means *efficient*. The interface should be a powerful tool that streamlines their existing workflow without getting in their way.

- **The Curious AI Enthusiast**: For this less-technical user, "simple" means *approachable*. The interface should be intuitive and guide them through the process of experimentation and analysis without requiring deep technical knowledge.

### Usability Goals

To achieve simplicity, we will target the following usability goals:

- **Ease of Learning**: A new user should be able to configure and save their first experiment within 10 minutes of opening the web UI.

- **Efficiency of Use**: An experienced user should be able to load a previous experiment, change a parameter, and save it as a new configuration in under 60 seconds.

- **Error Prevention**: The configuration form will provide immediate validation to prevent users from saving an invalid configuration.

- **Memorability**: The interface will be intuitive enough that a user can return after a week and not have to re-learn the workflow.

### Design Principles

We will follow these core principles to ensure a simple and effective design:

1. **Clarity Over Cleverness**: Prioritize clear, unambiguous labels and straightforward layouts over novel or complex interface designs.

2. **Progressive Disclosure**: Show only the most essential configuration options by default. More advanced or less frequently used parameters (e.g., `repeat_penalty`, `num_ctx`) will be available in an "Advanced Settings" section.

3. **Focus on the Task**: Every element on the screen must have a clear purpose. We will avoid visual clutter to keep the user's focus on either configuring an experiment or analyzing the results.

4. **Consistency**: The patterns used for creating a configuration (forms, buttons) and viewing results (dropdowns, tables, charts) will be consistent, making the application feel predictable and reliable.

## Information Architecture (IA)

### Site Map / Screen Inventory

This diagram shows the high-level structure of the web application and the key functions available on each page, as derived from the Software Design Specification.

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Web Application] --> B[ðŸ§ª Experiment Configuration]
    A --> C[ðŸ“Š Results Dashboard]
    
    subgraph Configuration Page
        B1[Create New Config via Form]
        B2[Edit Existing Config via Dropdown]
    end
    
    subgraph Results Page
        C1[Select Run via Dropdown]
        C2[Display Summary Metrics]
        C3[Display PEI Results Table]
        C4[Display Interactive Charts]
        C5[View Raw Conversation Log]
    end
    
    B -- Manages --> B_Data[(configs/*.yaml)]
    C -- Reads --> C_Data[(logs/*.jsonl)]
```

### Navigation Structure

**Primary Navigation**: The application will use a standard multi-page layout. Streamlit will automatically generate a sidebar menu containing links to the two primary pages: "ðŸ§ª Experiment Configuration" and "ðŸ“Š Results Dashboard".

**Secondary Navigation**: Navigation within each page will be handled by context-specific widgets. For example, a dropdown menu will be used to select an existing configuration to edit or a completed run to analyze.

**Breadcrumb Strategy**: Given the flat, two-page structure of the application, a breadcrumb navigation system is not necessary.

## User Flows

### User Flow 1: Create a New Experiment Configuration

**User Goal**: To create and save a valid config.yaml file for a new experiment using the web interface.

**Entry Point**: User navigates to the "ðŸ§ª Experiment Configuration" page from the sidebar.

**Success Criteria**: A new, valid .yaml file is saved to the configs/ directory, and the user sees a confirmation message.

**Flow Diagram**:

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Start on Config Page] --> B{Fill out Configuration Form}
    B --> C[Click 'Save Configuration']
    C --> D{Form Input Valid?}
    D -- No --> E[Display Inline Error Messages]
    E --> B
    D -- Yes --> F[Generate YAML Content]
    F --> G{File with same run_id exists?}
    G -- Yes --> H[Confirm Overwrite]
    H -- No --> B
    H -- Yes --> I[Save file to configs/ directory]
    G -- No --> I
    I --> J[Display Success Message]
```

**Edge Cases & Error Handling**:

- The run_id field is empty or contains characters that are invalid for a filename.
- A required numeric field (like cycle_count) is left empty or contains non-numeric text.
- The system should confirm with the user if they try to save a configuration with a run_id that already exists.
- The application should handle file system errors gracefully (e.g., if the configs/ directory is not writable).

### User Flow 2: View Experiment Results

**User Goal**: To select a completed experiment and view its summary metrics, charts, and raw log data.

**Entry Point**: User navigates to the "ðŸ“Š Results Dashboard" page from the sidebar.

**Success Criteria**: The dashboard correctly populates with the metrics, charts, and log data corresponding to the selected run.

**Flow Diagram**:

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Start on Results Page] --> B{Scan 'logs/' directory for .jsonl files}
    B --> C{Files Found?}
    C -- No --> D[Display 'No completed runs found.']
    C -- Yes --> E[Populate 'Select Run' Dropdown]
    E --> F[User Selects a Run]
    F --> G[Parse selected .jsonl file]
    G --> H{File Valid?}
    H -- No --> I[Display Error: 'Failed to parse log file.']
    H -- Yes --> J[Calculate Summary Metrics]
    J --> K[Update Dashboard with Metrics, Charts, and Log Data]
```

**Edge Cases & Error Handling**:

- The logs/ directory is empty, and a helpful message should be displayed.
- A selected .jsonl file is malformed or corrupted, and a user-friendly error should be shown.
- The log file is missing expected data, which should be handled gracefully without crashing the dashboard (e.g., show "N/A" for a metric).
- The log file is exceptionally large, and the application should ideally show a loading indicator while processing.

## Component Library / Design System

### Design System Approach

We will not be creating a custom component library. Instead, we will exclusively use the built-in, pre-styled components provided by the Streamlit framework. This approach ensures perfect visual consistency, significantly accelerates development, and aligns with the project's goal of creating a simple, functional data application without requiring custom front-end code.

### Core Components

**Component: Form Inputs** (`st.text_input`, `st.number_input`, `st.slider`)
- **Purpose**: To gather all the parameters for an experiment configuration.

**Component: Select Box** (`st.selectbox`)
- **Purpose**: To allow users to select an existing configuration file to load or a completed run log to analyze.

**Component: Button** (`st.form_submit_button`)
- **Purpose**: To trigger the action of saving an experiment configuration.

**Component: Data Display** (`st.metric`, `st.dataframe`)
- **Purpose**: To display summary statistics and detailed tabular data from the experiment logs.

**Component: Expander** (`st.expander`)
- **Purpose**: To conditionally hide complex or lengthy content, such as "Advanced Model Options" and the "View Full Conversation Log".

**Component: Chart** (`st.plotly_chart`)
- **Purpose**: To provide interactive visualizations of the experimental data.

## Branding & Style Guide

### Visual Identity

**Brand Guidelines**: N/A. The style will be dictated by the clean, default light and dark themes of the Streamlit framework.

### Color Palette

The application will use Streamlit's default color palette, optimized for readability.

| Color Type | Usage |
|------------|-------|
| Primary | Interactive elements like sliders and buttons. |
| Text | Default text colors for the selected theme. |
| Status | Standard colors (green, yellow, red) for notifications. |

### Typography

**Font Families**: The application will use the default sans-serif font stack provided by Streamlit.

**Type Scale**: We will use Streamlit's default semantic type scale for headings and body text.

### Iconography

**Icon Library**: We will use standard Unicode emojis for iconography in page navigation.

**Usage Guidelines**: Icons will be used sparingly to provide quick visual cues.

### Spacing & Layout

**Grid System**: The primary layout will be a single column, with st.columns used for side-by-side elements.

**Spacing Scale**: We will adhere to the default spacing provided by the Streamlit framework.

## Accessibility Requirements

### Compliance Target

**Standard**: No formal compliance standard (e.g., WCAG 2.1) is required. We will rely on the default accessibility features of the Streamlit framework.

### Key Requirements

**Interaction**: We will use standard Streamlit components, which render as semantic HTML and provide basic support for keyboard navigation and screen readers.

**Content**: We will use Streamlit's built-in functions for headers and labels to ensure a logical document structure.

### Testing Strategy

No automated accessibility testing is required. A brief manual check will be conducted to ensure basic keyboard navigability.

## Responsiveness Strategy

### Breakpoints

| Breakpoint | Target Behavior |
|------------|-----------------|
| Desktop / Wide Screens | The main content area and the navigation sidebar will be visible side-by-side. |
| Tablet / Mobile Screens | The sidebar will be collapsed by default and can be toggled open via a menu icon. |

### Adaptation Patterns

**Layout Changes**: The layout will shift from two columns to a single column on narrower screens. st.columns will stack vertically on mobile.

**Navigation Changes**: The main sidebar navigation will collapse into a hamburger menu icon on mobile viewports.

## Animation & Micro-interactions

### Motion Principles

- **Purposeful**: Animations will only be used to provide feedback or guide attention.
- **Subtle**: All motion will be fast, subtle, and non-disruptive.
- **Framework-Driven**: We will rely exclusively on the default animations provided by Streamlit and Plotly.

### Key Animations

- **Widget Feedback**: Subtle hover effects and focus indicators on interactive elements.
- **Status Notifications**: Simple fade transitions for status messages.
- **Interactive Chart Animations**: Smooth transitions and tooltips within Plotly charts.

## Performance Considerations

### Performance Goals

- **Initial Page Load**: The application should load in under 2 seconds.
- **UI Interaction**: All widgets must respond to user input instantaneously.
- **Data Loading**: A standard 10-cycle log file should be processed in under 5 seconds. A loading indicator (`st.spinner`) will be shown for longer operations.

### Design Strategies

- **Leverage Framework Efficiency**: Rely on Streamlit's efficient, built-in components.
- **Efficient Data Parsing**: Use the Pandas library to parse .jsonl log files.
- **Provide Loading Feedback**: Use `st.spinner` during time-consuming operations.
- **On-Demand Processing**: Data processing will only be triggered when a user selects a run.

## Next Steps
