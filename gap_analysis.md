# Gap Analysis: SoftwareDesignSpecification.md vs PRD and Architecture

## PRD Gaps Identified

### Missing or Incomplete Details:

1. **Six Core Components** - The PRD mentions components but doesn't explicitly list all six:
   - ExperimentRunner ✓ (mentioned)
   - CycleOrchestrator ✓ (mentioned)
   - AgentState ✓ (mentioned)
   - OllamaInterface ✓ (mentioned)
   - ToolDispatcher ✓ (mentioned)
   - LoggingService ✓ (mentioned)
   - All six ARE referenced, but could be more explicit

2. **State Machine Seven States** - Not explicitly documented:
   - LOAD_STATE
   - ASSEMBLE_PROMPT
   - INVOKE_LLM
   - PARSE_RESPONSE
   - DISPATCH_TOOL (conditional)
   - FINALIZE_CYCLE
   - TERMINATE_OR_CONTINUE

3. **System Prompt** - Full text from Appendix A not included in PRD

4. **PEI Scale Prompt** - Full text from Appendix A not included in PRD

5. **Reflection Template** - The JSON template from Appendix B not included

6. **Model Parameter Mapping Table** - Critical table from Section 3.2.2 not in PRD

7. **PromptAssembler Module** - Details from Section 3.1.2

8. **ResponseParser Module** - Details from Section 3.1.3

9. **EmbeddingService Specifics** - Model name and dimensions (all-MiniLM-L6-v2, 384-dimensional)

10. **Sample Config and Log Files** - From Appendix C

## Architecture Gaps Identified

### Sections Needing Completion:

1. **Data Models** - Need complete schemas:
   - AgentState (from Section 2.1)
   - Persistent Memory Store (from Section 2.2)
   - Log Record (from Section 2.3)
   - Experiment Configuration (from Section 2.4)

2. **Components** - Need detailed breakdowns of all six core components plus:
   - PromptAssembler
   - ResponseParser
   - MemoryTools class methods
   - send_message_to_operator function
   - EmbeddingService
   - SimilarityMonitor

3. **External APIs** - Need Ollama API integration details from Section 3.2

4. **Core Workflows** - Need state machine diagram and ReAct sub-loop sequence

5. **Database Schema** - Need TinyDB/SQLite schema from Section 2.2

6. **Frontend Architecture** - Need Streamlit details from Section 5

7. **Backend Architecture** - Need module organization

8. **Unified Project Structure** - Need directory tree

9. **Development Workflow** - Need setup instructions

10. **Deployment Architecture** - Need PyPI and CI/CD details

11. **Security and Performance** - Need considerations

12. **Testing Strategy** - Need comprehensive strategy

13. **Coding Standards** - Need standards for AI agents

14. **Error Handling Strategy** - Need patterns and examples

15. **Monitoring and Observability** - Need local monitoring strategy
